import pandas as pd

# Step 1: Read data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Step 2: Group the data by the column you want to split by
grouped = df.groupby("Category")

# Step 3: Iterate over the groups and export each group to a separate worksheet in an Excel file
writer = pd.ExcelWriter("output.xlsx", engine="xlsxwriter")  # create an ExcelWriter object

for name, group in grouped:  # iterate over the groups
    group.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=name, index=False)  # write each group to a separate worksheet

writer.save()  # save the Excel file
